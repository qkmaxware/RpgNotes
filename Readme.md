# RPG Notes
RPG Notes is a Blazor WebAssembly progressive web app (PWA) for assisting players of tabletop roleplaying games in organizing notes taken during their gameplay sessions.

# Usage
This application should be functional on all "modern" web browsers. It uses your browser's local cache as a storage device to save application data to. While this means that in most cases you can close the app and re-open it without losing any data, there are cases where your web-browser's cache may be cleared in which case this app will lose its data too. In order to save a permanent copy of the app data you can use the &#8942; menu on the main page of the app (where you select an active campaign) and select Export JSON to trigger a file download of the app data. This file can be re-imported using the same menu, but selecting Import JSON instead.
